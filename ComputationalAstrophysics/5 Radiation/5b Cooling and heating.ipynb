    "# RT Cooling and Heating\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook illustrates how to add cooling and heating by radiation transport (RT) to a prestellar core described by a Bonnor-Ebert sphere. The general idea is that the warm ISM that surrounds the BE-sphere is optically thick to UV-radiation, and can thus be kept at a constant temperature by being exposed to external radiation with that \"radiation temperature\".  The BE-sphere itself is very optically thick in UV-light, and is hence not affected much by the external UV, except in a thin boundary layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, the whole BE-sphere is optically transparent to infrared radiation.  As a simple example, we will use a warm ISM of 1000 L, with radiation field that peaks at about 3 $\\mu$m, while the cold ISM, which is about 100 times cooler peaks instead at of the order of 300 $\\mu$m."

    "At long wavelengths matter is much more transparent. That is why we use sub-mm and radio telescopes such as ALMA and VLA to observe star forming regions and pierce through dusty galaxies. The visual band has a weighted central wavelength of 540 nm. If there were a completely linear relation between extinction at different wavelengths, then the absorption at e.g.~1 mm would be $\\kappa = 220\\textrm{ cm}^2 \\textrm{ g}^{-1}\\,540\\textrm{ nm }/\\,1\\textrm{ mm} = 0.12\\textrm{ cm}^2 \\textrm{ g}^{-1}$. In reality the relation is not completely linear and a typical value for $\\kappa$ at a wavelength of 1 mm is $\\kappa_{mm} = 1\\textrm{ cm}^2 \\textrm{ g}^{-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computing opacities across a broad range of wavelengths is a herculean task, since the opacities depends on the microphysics. For contributions from the gas there is a dependency on the temperature and density and the chemistry and excitation / ionization state of the atoms and/or molecules. At large wavelength, the opacity is dominated by the dust, and the specific chemical composition and size distribution of the dust matters, as well as the fraction of heavier elements that are frozen out as refractory and icy dust.\n",

    "A useful python based tool to generate custom dust opacity tables was developed during the DSHARP project, and can be found here: https://github.com/birnstiel/dsharp_opac.\n",

    "An alternative to creating your own opacity table is to use one that has already been curated by others. For this exercise we will use an opacity table for dark clouds in the Milky Way created by Bruce Draine. See https://www.astro.princeton.edu/~draine/dust/dustmix.html\n",
    "\n",
    "We cheat a bit by making it more steep than observed so that opacities are higher in the Optical / UV. This is useful, because our box is quite small, and therefore too transparent at short wavelengths. Also notice that the chosen opacity table depends on the subject at hand. E.g. in a protoplanetary dik the opacity is less steep because of larger grains, while in the Warm ISM it may different. One table does not work for all cases!"

    "   * The very sharp discontinuity at the edge of the core is changing.\n",
    "   * The temperature is changing close to the pre-stellar core, and so does the velocities.\n",
    "   * The temperature at the center should stay at 10 K, but it can only do that if the heating in far infrared and the cooling in the radio is compensated for by a corresponding cooling (negative heating term), which in reality comes mainly from cosmic rays and CO line cooling.\n",

    "__Task 3a__ (30p): Run it for at least 400 iterations, but for as long as you like -- or as long as it works, and describe what is happening. What do you think is the physics driving the dynamics, and why does the setup evolve as it does?\n",
    "\n",
    "__Task 3b__ (10p): Add an artificial term based on the numerical heating rate inspired by the notes above, so that the central temperature is kept at 10 K. It should be analogue to a cosmic ray heating. It may be difficult to see the heating at the centre in the plots or images, because of the large cooling and heating at the edge, but you can measure it."
