    "An essential property of essentially all algorithms for solving the the radiation transport problem (Eq. 11) is that they are fundamentally _recursive_:  To get the solution at one point along a ray, one needs to know the solution at the previous (\"upstream\") point.  This necessitates writing algorithms as loops, which in Python is potentially enormously much slower than when array expressions may be used.\n",

So, as long as we can write a solver that operates \"array-wise\" over several solutions (rays) at once, there is no negative consequence of having to loop over the direction along the rays."
