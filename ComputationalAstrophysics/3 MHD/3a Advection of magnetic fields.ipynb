    "The evolution of the magnetic field is governed by the induction equation. In the MHD approximation, it can be written as\n",

    "where ${\\bf v}$ is the velocity of the fluid and ${\\bf B}$ is the magnetic field. The velocity evolution is coupled that of the magnetic field via the Lorentz force ($\\propto \\nabla\\times {{\\bf B} \\times {\\bf B}}$). For simplicity, assume that ${\\bf B}$ does not affect ${\\bf v}$, so we can prescribe ${\\bf v}$ externally. This is usually called the \"kinematic\" regime, where the momentum equation is solved decoupled from the induction equation (or just provides an external velocity field). Note that even in this regime, ${\\bf v}$ is, in general, a function of time and the three spatial coordinates.\n",

    "Induction equation is not a conservative equation. To illustrate this, let us expand the R.H.S. of the induction equation:\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $D/Dt = \\partial_t + {\\bf v}\\cdot \\nabla$ is the material derivative. \n",
    "\n",
    "As written above, the induction equation implies that the magnetic field is not conserved along fluid lines. It is not conserved because of source terms related to compression ($\\nabla . {\\bf v}\\neq 0$) and velocity gradients along the magnetic field ($\\left({\\bf B}\\cdot \\nabla\\right) {\\bf v}$). This last term, when coupled to the Lorentz force leads to Alfv√©n waves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, an update of the magnetic field must satisfy the solenoidal condition. This condition is clearly met analytically, but developing a numerical solver that does conserve $\\nabla\\cdot B$ imposes additional complications. \n",
    "\n",
    "The form of the induction equation combined with (i) the solenoidal constraint and (ii) a new family of waves that appear when coupling it with the momentum equation, makes it a challenging problem. \n",
    "However, some insight can be obtained by studying particular configurations where the induction gets simple."
